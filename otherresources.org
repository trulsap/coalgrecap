  Seems to be wikilike, has a few articles that hit exactly in our thing. 
** [[http://tunes.org/wiki/algebra_20and_20coalgebra.html]]
   
** [[http://tunes.org/wiki/induction_20and_20co-induction.html]]
   Gives rough overview of induction and co-induction, has some description of
   how this can be used to define functions (which I dont really understand),
   and also gives example of inductivly and co-inductively defined functions
   (more understandable)
